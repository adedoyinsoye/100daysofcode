# 100daysofcode
Hello there! 
I am Adedoyin, an aspiring Data scientist and here's my journey to becoming Badass in this field.
This Repository contains my journey to coding at least an hour everyday for 100 days. I've decided to make this public for the sake of accountability. 
I will be learning Python for Data Science using Datacamp and I will also be practising what I learn everyday using tasks gotten from SheCodeAfrica.
Ready...Set...Start!
